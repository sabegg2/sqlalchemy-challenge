## Files and Output

In the SurfsUp folder, I have included:

(1) [climate.ipynb](SurfsUp/climate.ipynb). This contains the Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data analysis. In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

(2) Images/Precipitation_Plot and Images/Station_Plot_USC00519281. These are two output images from the Part 1 analysis. 

Precipitation_Plot shows a line plot of precipitation over time for the last 12 months of data.  Below I include the same data, but in different format (the second matches that in the Module Challenge description, but the first was my own formatting).

Station_Plot_USC00519281 shows a histogram of the temperatures at Station USC00519281 for the last 12 months of data.

(3) [app.py](SurfsUp/app.py). This contains the code for Part 2: Design Your Climate App. I this section, I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1. When run, the app.py file creates the app at http://127.0.0.1:5000. Here's an image of the main page of the working app.

## External Resources

For me, sqlalchemy has been the most challenging concept of the course so far. I watched several lectures/tutorials on youtuble and googled the web for other tutorials.
